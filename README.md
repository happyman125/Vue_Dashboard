# Vue Cloudwatch Dashboard

![Screenshot](img/screenshot.png)

This project facilitates live monitoring CloudWatch metrics. All desired metrics are specified in JSON format.

PWA functionality allows the app to be cached on a mobile device after it's been served via `npm run serve` command.

A major problem with accessing CloudWatch metrics data is that metrics are often only reported when an event occurs. This results in data with many missing datapoints. The server-side Lambda function included in the project pads data with zero values whenever it is found to be missing.

The period, backfill time, and refresh interval are all configurable. They have been set with reasonable values of five minutes, five minutes, and two hours, respectively. Please note that AWS promises that CloudWatch metrics will be populated with a latency of at most ten minutes.

The charting capabilities of this project are limited in favor of a simple means of interacting with CloudWatch metrics data. More charting functionality may be added at a later date.

This project's aesthetic was heavily inspired by [Vuepoint](https://github.com/ashtonmeuser/vuepoint).

## Commands

First, clone the repo. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. Run one of the following commands to build.

```bash
# build for production
npm run build

# development mode
npm run dev

# run unit tests
npm test

# serve the bundled dist folder in production mode
npm run serve
```

## Credentials

The app expects there to be a `.env.{NODE_ENV}` file in the following format:

```
API_ENDPOINT={YOUR_API_ENDPOINT}
API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
```

Replace `NODE_ENV` with `development`, `test`, or `production`. These will be loaded when built for the respective environments and used to interact with your API. See the next section for setting up an endpoint using AWS Gateway and Lambda.

## Lambda Function

An AWS Lambda function can be used to serve properly formatted metrics to the CloudWatch Dashboard. Please see the [server](server) directory. To deploy, upload the [archive](server/archive.zip) to a Lambda function either via the AWS CLI or the web interface. If you make changes to the server-side logic, make sure you recreate and reupload the archive. 

Create an endpoint using AWS API Gateway properly secure it with an API key or other security measure.

Please note that AWS charges for accessing CloudWatch metrics, so securing your endpoint should be a priority. This should also influence the refresh rate you choose. CloudWatch pricing information can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

## AWS IAM Permissions

The Lambda function must have access to the `cloudwatch:GetMetricData` permission. Create a role in IAM to allow Lambda to access the correct resources.
